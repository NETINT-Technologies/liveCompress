# Instructions for creating checkpoints

Please use the training script in the `../training` folder to train the model. Once the training is complete, the checkpoint will be saved in that folder as `checkpoint_{lambda_value}_best_loss.pth.tar`. Copy that file into this current `checkpoints` directory.
